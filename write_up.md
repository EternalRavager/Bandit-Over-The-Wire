We start with opening cmd promt, connecting to the server using cmd ‘ssh’.
- After connecting to the server we use cmds to access different directories and files to find the password to the next level. 
-	For the lvls 0-2 I was able to clear them using the commands ‘ls’ and ‘cat’.
Here I learned that for reading files with spaces I have to type the name in  “”
And for reading files that start with ‘-‘ I have to use ‘./’ before the name of the file.
-	For the lvl 3 I had to change into a new directory which I did with the help of the cms ‘cd’.
-	For lvl 4 I tried it initially by reading all files and finding the correct password but it was the wrong approach, then I did it by using the ‘find’ cmd to find out the type of the files that exist and read the correct file.
-	For lvl 5 I simply used the ‘file’ cmd. 
-	For lvl 6 I simply found all the files and read the one file for which the permission was not denied had the pswd.
- For lvl 7 I learnt about the ‘grep’ cmd and used it to find the word millionth and obtained the pswd.
-	For lvl 8 I learnt about the cmd ‘sort’ and ‘uniq’ to find out the unique lines in a sorted manner. I used a tag in uniq to see which line occurred only once.
-	For lvl 9 I learnt the use of ‘strigns’ cmd to find all printable characters and used grep along with it.
-	For lvl 10 I used ‘base64 -d’ to decode the answer.
-	I used youtube and google to learn some stuff, like the use of ssh and cmds.
-	For lvl 11 I took help and then completed it.
-	~ means the home directory of the logged-on user whereas ~/ means the path to the beginning of a directory.
-	I operated on lvl 12 with great difficulty, I watched 2 tutorials on youtube and used ‘bzip2’, ‘gzip -d’, mv, xxd -r, tar -xf to clear this lvl.
-	In lvl 13 I got the pswd for lvl14 by using the private key.
-	In lvl 14 I simply got the pswd by connecting to a new port and reentering the pswd.
-	In lvl 15 after connecting to the port and entering the pswd I got the next pswd
-	In lvl 16 after finding the ports and connecting to them one by one of them gave me a rsa key which I copied and saved it and encrypted it and then used it as a key to get to lvl 17
-	In lvl 17 I used the cmd “diff” to find the different lines and used both the pswds to check which one is correct
-	In lvl 18 I used the cmds along with the ssh line to read the file and get the pswds, I read abt this online
-	In lvl 19 I switched to bandit20-do and read the file. I did not understand the concept of it as I did it by watching it online
